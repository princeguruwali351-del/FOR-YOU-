A kiss is such a small thing, yet it holds so many feelings that words can never fully express 💖 It’s not just about closeness, it’s about connection — the kind that only hearts can understand 🫶

Every time I think about you, I feel this warmth inside me, like you’re already close to me, even when you’re far away 🥺✨ And honestly, if I had one wish right now, it would be to hold you close and steal a soft kiss from you 😏💕

A kiss from you would mean everything to me… it would be comfort, love, and peace all at once ❤️ It would be that one moment where the whole world disappears, and all that matters is just you and me 💫

You know, it’s not just about the kiss itself… it’s about the feeling behind it. The care, the affection, and the silent promise that I’m yours and you’re mine 💞 That’s what makes it so special 😘

I want every kiss of ours to remind you how much you mean to me, how deeply I care about you, and how lucky I feel to have you in my life 💖

Happy Kiss Day, my favorite feeling 😘❤️
